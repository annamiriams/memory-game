<img src="./img/application-overview.png" alt="An image of the OH, FLOCK! web application. On the left, the title is shown over a reset button, with instructions below. On the left, there is a turns tally, a match tally, and a board of twelve cards showing an image of a Scissor-tailed flycatcher."/>

## Description
A Wingspan-themed, single-player memory game where as the player, you flip two cards over per turn. If the cards are a match, they remain upright and you are one step closer to winning. If the cards don't match, they both flip back over again. You have ten turns total to find all matches before the game is over. Hope your memory serves you well!

* This game utilizes illustrations from the board game Wingspan. As a birdwatcher and board game enthusiast, Wingspan is one of my all time favorites. A memory game of this size is not typically considered a particularly challenging web browser game, so I attempted to make it a tad trickier by including birds with similar colored plumage. 

## <a name="nextsteps"></a>Project Next Steps
* Add more card pairs on deck, allowing the user to choose a custom-sized board (i.e. 10 pairs, 14 pairs, or 18 pairs possible).
* Replace the tally board with a timer.
* Add visual effects to pair with a matched pair, win, and/or loss.

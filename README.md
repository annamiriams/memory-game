## Description
A Wingspan-themed, single player game memory game where the player flips two cards over per turn. If the cards are a match, they remain upright and the user is one step closer to winning. If the cards don't match, they both flip back over again. The user has ten turns total to find all matches before the game is over. Hope your memory serves you well!

* This game utilizes illustrations from the board game Wingspan. As a birdwatcher and board game enthusiast, Wingspan is one of my all time favorites. A memory game of this size is not typically considered a particularly challenging web browser game, so I attempted to make it a tad trickier by including birds with similar colored plumage.

* Add more card pairs on deck, allowing the user to choose a custom-sized board (i.e. 10 pairs, 14 pairs, or 18 pairs possible).
* Replace the tally board with a timer.

*Understanding “this” in JQUERY: 
* 	the this object doesn't change. It is the owner of the function. It is, in most cases like this, simply a node and you can reference all of its properties like this.className. (think of it as you would a node or whatnot that you get with document.getElementById). It is just the "owner" of the function. Therefore, you are just passing the this object to jQuery's $(). Conclusion: If you want to use jQuery functions for the current node, use $(this). But if you want to access the objects own properties (e.g. .name, className, .id), use simply this.

* A constructor: A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is created. Here are the key differences between aconstructor and a method: A constructor doesn't have a return type. ... Unlike methods, constructorsare not considered members of a class.
